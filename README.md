This is my first landing page created using css and html. It is part of the odin project course.

Major issue I had: I attempted to create a spinning logo when hovered on. The position of the logo was fixed. The spinning transformation only worked when the logo was in its inherit postion. As soon as you scroll down the trasnfromation does not work.
I attempted to change the spinning axis. I was not successful. My attempt to create the logo transformation is now a comment. 

This website is created to create awareness about complex indentities via a humeristics analyses of nerds that solve rubik cubes. I have nver been able to solve a cube. And I dislike those who can.
